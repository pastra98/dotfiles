# dotfiles
These are just my personal configuration files for programs such as vimrc

dotfiles_setup.sh is a script that automatically creates a softlink in the home directory for every file listed in it.

note to self: this repository contains the local vimrc file, the global vim settings are still stored in /etc/vim/.vimrc
